    <span class="table-mark">What is S.E.O?</span>    
    <p>SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, it means the process of improving your site to increase its visibility when people search for products or services related to your business in Google, Bing, and other search engines. The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to garner attention and attract prospective and existing customers to your business</p>
    <br>
    <span class="table-mark">How does S.E.O Work?</span>
    <p>Search engines such as Google and Bing use bots to crawl pages on the web, going from site to site, collecting information about those pages and putting them in an index. Think of the index like a giant library where a librarian can pull up a book (or a web page) to help you find exactly what you’re looking for at the time.</p>
    <span class="table-mark">keyword Tagging</span>
    <p>Below I have Compiled a list of keywords used to tag your page. I have compiled the list based on what I belive will best match your target customers 
      and highest possible ranking. The list includes the monitored traffic of each keyword. To Simplify this chart you can think of the KD as the keywords scoring between 0-100 100 being the best.

    <div class="list-container">
      <iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="./list.txt"></iframe>
    </div>
    <span class="table-mark">Title Tags</span>
    <p>This is the label of your content and how searches see your page in Google and Bing.</p>
    <b>Title Used: Women's Voices Of South West Florida</b>
    <br>
    <span class="table-mark">Meta Description</span>
    <p>Another vital HTML tag for SEO is the meta description. Like titles, this information shows in search results of Google. Take a look under the link for any search. The snippet of text under the title is usually pulled from the description tag</p>
    <b>Description Used: WVSWFL is a non-partisan grassroots movement made up of Floridians who are dedicated to defending civil liberties and reproductive freedoms.</b>
    <br>
    <span class="table-mark">Open Graph Tags</span>
    <p>Open graph tags help in boosting search and display abilities for social media. For instance, Facebook will use open graph to display information if your content is shared.</p>
    <span class="table-mark">Twitter Card Tags</span>
    <p>Open graph isn’t the only way to customize data for social media. Twitter has its own platform called “Cards.” Twitter Cards work similar to OG with the exception that these are specifically for Twitter.</p>
    <span class="table-mark">Responsive Site Meta Tags</span>
    <p>This means you need to focus attention on responsive and mobile designs. Let’s face it, it’s crucial to have a mobile-friendly website to succeed today. It’s important to note that Google puts emphasis on websites that are mobile-friendly. And if you don’t have something readily available that people can view from a hand-held device, it will reflect your rankings in search.</p>
